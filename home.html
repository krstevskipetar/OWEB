        Hello, my name is Petar Krstevski and I'm a student at the faculty of <br><img class="CVpic" src="https://i.imgur.com/xD0iC3l.jpg">electrical engineering and information
        technologies
        at Ss. Cyril and Methodius University-Skopje. I am a computer engineering major and I hope that in the future I will work more in this field. I was born on the 10th of August, 2000 and 
        I am currently in my junior year. Other than college-related matters, my hobbies and interests are fairly mundane, I enjoy listening to music, playing chess and video games, watching 
        films and series', but more on that some other time.
