        Hello, my name is Petar Krstevski and I'm a student at the <a href="https://feit.ukim.edu.mk/">Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information
                Technologies</a><img class="CVpic"
            src="https://i.imgur.com/xD0iC3l.jpg">
        at Ss. Cyril and Methodius University-Skopje. I major in computer engineering and I am currently in my junior year. I hope that in the future I
        will work more in this field. I was born on the 10th of August, 2000 in Skopje, Macedonia. Before enrolling in
        university, I got my high-school diploma at SUGS Gimnazija "Orce Nikolov". My hobbies and interests are fairly
        standard, I enjoy listening to <a href="favorites.html"> music, playing video games, watching
            movies and TV shows</a> as well as going out with friends. You can read more about my day-to-day life <a href="blog.html">here.</a>
